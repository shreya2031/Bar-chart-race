# Svelte Bar Chart Race

Recreating Bostock's [D3 Bar Chart Race](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race), but with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). This is the codebase for our talk for [Svelte Summit 2021](https://sveltesummit.com/).

## Want to help?
These are some Svelte issues on Github that would enable even better support for doing fully declarative data visualization that follow the D3 join pattern (enter, update, exit).
