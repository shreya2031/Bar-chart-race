            In this visualization, our main objective was to effectively comprehend the contributions of various energy sources for electricity production over time, from 1989 to 2021. We explored different visualization methods to add interactivity including diverging stacked bar charts (for renewable and non-renewable sources). Although the diverging stacked bar charts had their advantages, we ultimately opted for the bar chart race to dynamically showcase the evolution of energy sources for electricity generation from 1989 to 2022. This choice was driven by the desire to create an engaging and informative representation of global energy trends over time. The dynamic movement of bars provides a visually compelling narrative of how different energy sources have evolved through the years.
<br>
                We used data from <a href="https://github.com/owid/energy-data?tab=readme-ov-file#data-on-energy-by-our-world-in-data">Our World in Data</a>. The dataset covered information regarding usage of various energy sources for electricity generation and primary energy consumption across different countries. To ensure the usability of this data, we preprocessed it through several key steps. Addressing missing values was a pivotal step for data integrity, employing techniques such as removal based on the extent of missingness. Additionally, uniformity in data formats was ensured, especially date formats.
<br>
                The focus then shifted to attributes directly relevant to the visualization goal, we extracted percentages of different sources of energy for electricity generation  for each year. With the objective of analyzing trends in electricity generation over the years, the dataset underwent aggregation by calculating the average percentage of electricity generated from each energy source across all countries for each year. Finally, the processed dataset was exported into JSON format to make it suitable for bar chart race visualization. Ranking the energy sources for every year based on their usage was tricky. We had to carefully decide a way to order the sources according to their percentages in the bar chart for every year. We made a script that took the pre-processed data as input and returned a JSON file with rankings for all energy sources from 1 to 8 based on usage for every year. This file served as the input for the chart.
<br>
                For this visualization, several thoughtful visual encodings were implemented to enhance user experience and clarity. Labels were added to each bar in the chart to provide crucial information about the percentage of electricity generated from different sources. Some challenges arose while figuring out how to place the labels beside the bars. However, through iterative testing and adjustments a suitable positioning was identified, ensuring visibility without obstructing the chart's overall aesthetics. A solid color palette was selected to differentiate between various energy sources for clear identification and interpretation of the data. In addition to labels and colors, we experimented with different fonts and their weights to find a balance that is visually appealing and effective. This exploration aimed to ensure that the text elements complemented the overall design, enhancing readability. The x-axis (from bottom to top order) consists of percentages where one unit represents 5%. The animation pace was adjusted by setting the duration between keyframes (data for every year) to 1000 milliseconds i.e., 1 second. To enhance user interactivity, a replay button was incorporated into the visualization. This feature allows users to replay the bar chart race, enabling them to review and analyze the evolution of energy sources for electricity generation multiple times. 
<br>
                The development process involved a team effort with a focus on understanding and adapting code from the open source race bar chart documentation. The project took approximately 50 people-hours to complete. This time was distributed across the different phases of the project, from initial design to final implementation. Shivani led the dataset preprocessing, transforming it into the desired JSON format. Shreya took charge of visualization implementation and design refinement, while Saloni managed documentation and assisted in troubleshooting. The most time-consuming aspect was grasping and customizing the code from the documentation to suit our specific use case.
