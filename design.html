In this visualization, our main objective was to effectively comprehend the contributions of various energy sources for electricity production over time, spanning from 1990 to 2021. We explored different visualization methods to add interactivity including diverging stacked bar charts. Although the diverging stacked bar charts had their advantages, we ultimately opted for the bar chart race to dynamically showcase the evolution of energy sources for electricity generation from 1900 to 2022. This choice was driven by the desire to create an engaging and informative representation of global energy trends over time. The dynamic movement of bars provides a visually compelling narrative of how different energy sources have evolved through the years.
<br>
                We used data from Our World in Data. It includes information about how energy sources are used throughout the world from 1900 to 2022. The dataset covered information regarding usage of  various energy sources for electricity generation and primary energy consumption across different countries. To ensure the usability of this data, we meticulously preprocessed it through several key steps. Addressing missing values was a pivotal step for data integrity, employing techniques such as removal based on the extent of missingness. Additionally, uniformity in data formats, especially date formats, was ensured to facilitate seamless analysis.
<br>
The focus then shifted to attributes directly relevant to the visualization goal, we extracted percentages of different sources of energy for electricity generation  for each year. With the overarching objective of analyzing trends in electricity generation over the years, the dataset underwent aggregation by calculating the average percentage of electricity generated from each energy source across all countries for each year. This entailed determining the average percentage for each energy source in a specific year, allowing for a comprehensive overview and identification of overall trends. Finally, to enhance the visual representation, the processed dataset was exported into JSON format, rendering it suitable for barchart race visualization and enabling a dynamic portrayal of the evolution of energy generation sources over time.
<br>
In the creation of the barchart race visualization, several thoughtful visual encodings were implemented to enhance user experience and clarity. Labels were strategically added to each bar in the chart to provide crucial information about the percentage of electricity generated from different sources. Initially, challenges arose in determining an optimal placement ensuring clarity for viewers. However, through iterative testing and adjustments, a suitable positioning was identified, ensuring visibility without obstructing the chart's overall aesthetics. The choice of colors for each bar in the barchart race was deliberate, aiming to convey information effectively. A harmonious color palette was selected to differentiate between various energy sources while maintaining visual coherence. This decision aids in clear identification and interpretation of the data, contributing to a more engaging and comprehensible visualization. In addition to labels and colors, we experimented with different fonts and their weights to find a balance that is visually appealing and effective. This exploration aimed to ensure that the text elements complemented the overall design, enhancing readability. To enhance user interactivity and engagement, a replay button was incorporated into the visualization. This feature allows users to replay the barchart race, enabling them to review and analyze the evolution of energy sources for electricity generation multiple times. The inclusion of this replay functionality adds a layer of user control, ensuring a dynamic and user-friendly experience. Ranking each energy source in our barchart race was tricky. We had to carefully decide a fair way to show which sources were more important over time. It took some testing and trying different ideas to figure out the best way to do it.

<br>
The development process involved a team effort with a focus on understanding and adapting code from open source race bar chart documentation. The team dedicated four days to this task. Shivani led the dataset preprocessing, transforming it into the desired JSON format. Shreya took charge of visualization implementation and design refinement, while Saloni managed documentation and assisted in troubleshooting. Each team member contributed roughly 10-15 hours to the project. The most time-consuming aspect was grasping and customizing the code from the documentation to suit our specific use case.
